"""
PARSE BY LOCATION

The next section of code will parse a CSV file pulled from AD to sort security groups by location(department)

Requirements:
  1. You will need a CSV file formatted with the following header: 
  	- title, department, physicaldeliveryoffice, memberof
  2. Ensure memberof values use ';' as a delimiter

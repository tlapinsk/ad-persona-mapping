# Active Directory Persona Mapping

This short script parses data pulled from Active Directory and performs rudimentary data analysis. Created to speed up data analysis that would have taken at least 10x longer using just Excel.

Below are quick instructions to help get you started.

### My Specs

Windows 7

Python 3.6.3

### PowerShell

You will need to start by pulling AD data using PowerShell (or some other method). Personally, I recommend the following PowerShell script

	Get-ADUser -SearchBase "ou=example,ou=example,dc=example,dc=net" -Filter * -Properties * 
	| Select-Object -Property title, department, physicaldeliveryofficename, @{n='MemberOf'; e= { ( $_.memberof 
	| % { (Get-ADObject $_).Name }) -join ";" }} | Sort-Object -Property 
	| export-CSV C:\temp\example.csv

This will output Job Title, Department, Office, and MemberOf security groups formatted nicely. 

I have also uploaded a sample CSV file for you to take a look at. Your CSV should look similar to the example.

### Git clone

Move to the directory where you would like to clone the repository.

	git clone https://github.com/tlapinsk/ad-persona-mapping.git
	cd ad-persona-mapping

### Customize persona-mapping.py

Starting on line 27, customize the location lists `location_group` to your companies location data. Make sure you change the names in the loop too (30-45).

Change list names `count_location` and append to list names from 53-87.

Finally, change the `sort_location` names from 91-114.

### Run persona-mapping.py

Execute persona-mapping.py script via the command line

	python persona-mapping.py
